          I'm a Mandela Washington Fellow 2024 and hold a BSc in Electrical Engineering and a BA in Management, with enhanced expertise from ISS at Technical University of Munich. I led as Co-Founder and CEO of Agelgil Eco-Packaging since 2021 G.C. My approach as a steward entrepreneur emphasizes innovation, environmental conservation, and the empowerment of the youth in green entrepreneurship. Recognized as Land Restoration Champion Africa 2025 and an Africa Prize Alumni (2022), and winner of the Bruh Innovation Award, my journey illustrates the impact of pioneering solutions and collaborative efforts in sustainable development. Beyond steering Agelgil, I dedicate myself as a mentor, trainer, and volunteer, nurturing future women leaders in STEM across Africa.
