            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>
I‚Äôm Afomia Andualem ‚Äî a purpose-driven entrepreneur, mentor, author, and advocate for sustainability, anchored leadership, and community transformation. My life is guided by a vision to build a legacy of impact, integrity, and service ‚Äî one grounded in faith and covered by grace.
My academic background includes a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Bahir Dar University, a BA in Management from Alpha University, and further  studies in Sustainable Entrepreneurship at the Technical University of Munich(ISS 2023). I also completed business leadership training at Clark Atlanta University as part of the Mandela Washington Fellowship.

                  At my core, I believe in building systems that serve both people and the planet. In 2021, I co-founded Agelgil Eco-Packaging, a company that transforms agricultural waste into tree-free packaging solutions.<br /> 
                  Our mission wasn‚Äôt just environmental‚Äîit was deeply social, empowering local communities and reducing dependency on plastic. While Agelgil continues to grow as its own entity, it remains a proud piece of my broader life‚Äôs work.<br /> 

I also co-founded Yegna Impact, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering women and youth through sustainability education, mental health advocacy, and inclusive development. Through this and other initiatives, I‚Äôve been fortunate to lead, mentor, and collaborate across Africa and globally. <br />


In addition to building ventures, I am a published author and proud of my journey into writing. My first book marked a personal milestone, and I am now preparing to release my second book titled "Little Me with Big Dreams", which shares my story of faith, courage, and leadership as a young African woman creating change. I also serve as a board member at the Pahal Horizon International Research Journal, where I help elevate research and reflection on development and sustainability topics across the Global South. <br />

My mentorship work spans several platforms ‚Äî including MicroMentor, YALI RLC, the Tony Elumelu Foundation, and my own initiative: the Anchored Generation Academy, a mentoring and coaching program I established to empower anchored, responsible young leaders. I actively mentor women in STEM through a Royal Academy of Engineering‚Äìfunded program in partnership with Plymouth University, and support cross-border empowerment programs in Kenya and Ethiopia. <br />

Beyond professional platforms, I serve my community through volunteer work at my local church, where I support youth education and women‚Äôs groups. I believe service is a lifestyle ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs mentoring a student, planting a tree, or simply showing up with compassion.
One of the joys of my journey is connecting people ‚Äî across countries, communities, and continents. I regularly use my global network to link young innovators, organizations, and changemakers with opportunities for collaboration, learning, and scale.
My story is still unfolding, but I hope every chapter reflects the same intention: to live with purpose, build with heart, and uplift others ‚Äî always.
